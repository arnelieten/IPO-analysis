code for my master thesis in finance (What textual, visual, and sentiment characteristics found in IPO prospectuses influence underpricing of European stocks)


abstract

The prospectus is a crucial component in the initial public offering (IPO) process for firms in Europe. According to signaling theory, the length, readability, visual content, and sentiment within the prospectus should influence investors' valuation of the IPO. This study finds that IPOs with longer prospectuses and negative sentiment are associated with higher underpricing one-day post-IPO. In contrast, a greater number of visuals correlates with lower underpricing, while readability and positive sentiment have no significant effect. Moreover, the influence of sentiment on underpricing diminishes over time. The results provide empirical evidence that, regardless of content, the framing of the prospectus significantly affects market dynamics, indicated by variations in underpricing.
